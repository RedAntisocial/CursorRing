## Performance Optimizations
- Added UI scale correction for accurate cursor positioning
- Separated cursor position updates from cast effect processing for lower latency in OnUpdate
- Cursor ring now updates every frame via OnUpdate
- Cast effects now update via an independent timer and NOT every frame
- Added ClearAllPoints() before SetPoint() calls to reduce spike in memory usage when turning on trails and sparkles

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed cursor ring offset issue at non-1.0 UI scales
- Fixed cast fill/segments not centering properly during scaling animation
- Cast effects now stay reliably attached to ring during movement
